<h1>CO880 Corpus</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

Author is:		Pierre Alletru (pa211@kent.ac.uk)<br />
Supervisor is:		Colin Johnson (C.G.Johnson@kent.ac.uk)<br />
<br />
Subject of the project is: Kinect Hacking.<br />
<br />
Project name of the corpus is: <b>Air</b>.<br />
<br />
The Air project is divided in two sub-projects :<br />
- NiFingersGenerator, an OpenNI module to detect fingers. OpenNI is a framework for Natural Interactions (NI). See <a href="www.openni.org">OpenNI</a>.<br />
- Air, an interface to control Ubuntu and Windows 7 operating systems using hand and fingers gestures.<br />
<br />
The archive on the CD is actually a compressed copy of the project repository, available <a href="https://github.com/DoobleD/Air">here</a>.<br />
<br />
The primary goal of the project was to be able to control an OS with hand and/or fingers gesture.<br />
<br />
While the project is not quite stable at this point, the goal of detecting fingers has been reached, as well as the goal of offering some basic gestures controlling
the OS. However, gesture recognition often produce errors. The software demonstrate that things are possible, but is currently not usable for confortable real day to day use.
<br /><br />
In other words, you will probably encounter some difficulties to correctly manipulate your computer.<br />

<h2>Where to start?</h2>

1 - The first thing to do is to look at the README file in <a href="https://github.com/DoobleD/Air">the sources root directory</a>.<br />
<br />
The README contains information about how to install or/and compile the project.<br />
<br />
2 - Read the user guide. Available in the 'documentation' directory, or <a href="https://github.com/DoobleD/Air/tree/master/documentation">here</a>.<br />
<br />
The user guide explains how to use the project.<br />
<br />
3 - As it is written in the user guide, watching the video tutorial is probably the best way to learn how to perform the gestures in front of your Kinect.<br /><br />
